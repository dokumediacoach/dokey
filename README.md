# dokey

A powershell script that shows a GUI with which passwords can be generated.

With dokey you can generate passwords that meet certain requirements.
Presets can be defined in data file dokey-settings.psd1.
If you copy a password with the corresponding button, the clipboard is cleared after 20 seconds.

## What dokey cannot do

With dokey you cannot store / manage passwords. Better use a password manager for that.
The main focus of the tool is for admin tasks where new users are registered with strong initial passwords.
